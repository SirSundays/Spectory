Spectory (discontinued)

Spectory was a system planned for organizing laboratories and their stock at universities. Unfortunately, there were not the resources and time to finish the project. There is only functionality to document ordered and incoming packages.
It was built upon Angular, NodeJS, MariaDB, and Keycloak as Authentification Service.
The good thing about the project:
It brought me to Keycloak which I will reuse in many future projects.
